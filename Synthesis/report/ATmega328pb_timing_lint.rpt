Timing exceptions with no effect

The following timing exceptions are not currently affecting timing in the       
design in mode 'view_tt_v1p5_25c'.  Either no paths in the design satisfy the   
exception's path specification, or all paths that satisfy the path              
specification also satisfy an exception with a higher priority.  You can        
improve runtime and memory usage by removing these exceptions if they are not   
truly needed.  To see if there is a path in the design that satisfies the path  
specification for an exception, or to see what other exception is overriding an 
exception because of priority, use the command:
